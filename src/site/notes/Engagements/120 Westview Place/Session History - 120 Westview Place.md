# The Engagement

## Start-Of-Engagement Moves
[Chonko](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Chonko.md) had a _premonition_ and saw a clouded image of something bad that had not yet transpired. The vision showed a metal shovel piercing through the meat of someone's shin.


## Teaser/Background Information

The hunters read two articles about the situation, the [1984 Article](../../Engagements/120%20Westview%20Place/Materials/1984%20Article.md) and the [2024 Article](../../Engagements/120%20Westview%20Place/Materials/2024%20Article.md) article. These came from local papers and cover goings on at the house at 120 Westview Place. In the house lived the Herberts:
- [Paul Herbert](Bystanders/Paul%20Herbert.md), father, web designer
- [Rebecca Herbert](Bystanders/Rebecca%20Herbert.md), mother, former lawyer
- [Willie Herbert](Bystanders/Willie%20Herbert.md), 11-year old boy with asthma and a motivation to make crude jokes

[Paul Herbert](Bystanders/Paul%20Herbert.md) was unhappy with the attention from the newspapers, which came to his door after one of [Willie Herbert](Bystanders/Willie%20Herbert.md)'s teachers heard that the new kid lived in a house matching the description of the [Keefe House](Locations/Keefe%20House.md).

[Rebecca Herbert](Bystanders/Rebecca%20Herbert.md) didn't like the attention either, and was getting pretty freaked out by the events. Luckily, Rebecca was a fan of sailing and saw the company boat sailing around the world. She off-handedly mentioned MythSecure to Paul, who in that moment dismissed the idea. She found his explanations comforting enough at first.

Paul was willing to dismiss the events, including when he stood on his digital bathroom scale which managed to spell out the word *GUILTY* under his feet. He didn't mention this to Rebecca, but instead called MythSecure to get a rational explanation.

We began with the hunters grabbing a late afternoon at a local restaurant after a drive up from the city. They had a call with their engagement manager [Daniel Evers](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Personnel/Daniel%20Evers.md) who explained the situation.

After explaining the situation, Evers reminded the hunters that they were going to enter a family's home. They should be nice and maybe not go in with all their weapons visible.

## Arriving on Location

The hunters debriefed at a restaurant nearby the location, and then went directly to the house. During the debrief, their engagement manager [[Mythsecure-Organization/Personnel/Daniel Evers\|Daniel Evers]] instructed them that perhaps they should not show all of their weapons to the family in order to not scare them.

Before entering the house, the hunters left some gear in their vehicles. When they entered, the hunters had the following weapons:
- [Mr. Miata](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Mr.%20Miata.md) took only 9mm pistol, leaving a sniper rifle and big knife behind
- [Asha](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Asha.md) took all of her gear, as it fit in pockets/bags. (.38 revolver, folding knife, )
- [Lady Squatch](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Lady%20Squatch.md) stashed her razor whip in the magical space, bringing it into the house
- [Chonko](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Chonko.md) took only a knife, leaving a shotgun behind
- [Dullface](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Dullface.md) brought only his nunchucks


They knocked on the door and didn't make a great first impression, including when [Mr. Miata](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Mr.%20Miata.md) failed a roll to avoid a "mind goblin" joke from [Willie Herbert](Bystanders/Willie%20Herbert.md). Eventually the Herberts let the team inside, though the family was a bit suspicious of the ragtag group that claimed to be professionals.

They entered into a living room with a large dining table, a door to the kitchen, a large clock, fireplace and photos on the walls. There was an ornate staircase leading upstairs as well as large hanging mirror.

## Speaking with the Herbert Family

[Paul Herbert](Bystanders/Paul%20Herbert.md) left the room to fetch a pitcher of lemonade. [Rebecca Herbert](Bystanders/Rebecca%20Herbert.md) revealed that she had the word GUILTY scratched into her leg, but she did not feel it happening. Sometimes she felt/found fur around the house, though.

As the parents were talking, [Mr. Miata](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Mr.%20Miata.md) paid attention to Willie's reactions - spending a luck point to do so. This meant that the next time that [Mr. Miata](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Mr.%20Miata.md) dealt with the Agency, there was going to be a lot of red tape. Mr. Miata observed that during the conversation, Willie was looking around at the floor of the house.

The hunters asked [Willie Herbert](Bystanders/Willie%20Herbert.md) to go upstairs as not to frighten him, and [Asha](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Asha.md) went upstairs on the pretense that they were going to chat. At first, Rebecca was not keen on letting Asha go up alone with her child, but  [Lady Squatch](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Lady%20Squatch.md) _soothed_ her and invited her to go chat in another room. They did, leaving [Paul Herbert](Bystanders/Paul%20Herbert.md), [Chonko](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Chonko.md), [Dullface](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Dullface.md) and [Mr. Miata](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Mr.%20Miata.md) in the living room.

Upstairs, [Asha](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Asha.md) did not go talk to [Willie Herbert](Bystanders/Willie%20Herbert.md), but instead opened a door to the master bedroom. Above the bed, she saw the word GUILTY written in lipstick on "the side of the bed without night cream and hand lotion on the nightstand."

[Lady Squatch](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Lady%20Squatch.md) spoke with [Rebecca Herbert](Bystanders/Rebecca%20Herbert.md), who was reluctant to talk about why she left her previous job and moved to the new house. [Lady Squatch](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Lady%20Squatch.md) communed with her divine sasquatch masters to try and find out why, but only got the answer "_WORK STUFF_."

[Mr. Miata](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Mr.%20Miata.md) walked around the living room and noticed that much of the furniture and items inside were from other families. It appeared as if those families left in a hurry, and the best way to protect the Herberts was to get them out of the house. Mr. Miata used his _empath_ skill to feel if Paul was hiding anything, but didn't sense anything new. 

The hunters then had a team huddle away from the family and decided that they should ask the Herberts to leave the house so the hunters can work without bothering them, and possibly get them away from danger. Though reluctant at first, the hunters charmed the family into getting ready to leave. Willie came down from upstairs at the promise of ice cream.

## Things Get Violent

[Lady Squatch](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Lady%20Squatch.md) attempted to open the front door, but it wouldn't budge. At the same time, the hunters heard what sounded like a room full of rusty squeaking wheels and from under the door came an enormous [swarm of rats](Minions/The%20Rats.md) which attacked Lady Squatch, throwing her to the ground. The house then echoed with an otherworldly screech.

At this point, Mr. Miata became so frozen with terror he was out of action for the rest of the session. (_Player departure_)

On the side of the room with the staircase stood Dullface, Chonko and Asha. Separated from them by the snarling frenzy of rats stood Lady Squatch and the Herberts, who could access the kitchen, garage, and the door to the basement.

The hunters then noticed the specter of [Colleen Keefe](Monster/Colleen%20Keefe.md) at the top of the stairs. Everywhere her eyes went, so did the gaze of the rats. Dullface charged to attack with his nunchucks, but they passed harmlessly through Colleen, who then caused it to fly out of Dullface's hands and strike him in the face before falling to the bottom of stairs.

Colleen then flew down the stairs towards Lady Squatch and the Herberts, but Asha stepped in by picking the ornate mirror from the wall and throwing it into Colleen's path. Colleen stopped to look at her reflection, but then shattered the mirror - spraying glass shards into the air. Shards hit Asha, as well as the rat swarm.  This caused the rats to flee, scattering into holes in the floor, walls, and other rooms - many fleeing down the stairs to the basement.

Lady Squatch then grabbed the Herbert family and attempted to teleport them to safety, but instead mysteriously vanished - not to return for the rest of the session (_Player departure_) With Colleen distracted by the mirror, the Herberts fled to the garage with the ghost hot on their heels.

The remaining hunters chased Colleen into the garage, and noticed it contained rusty old tools from the nearby farms such as rakes and scythes, as well as snow shovels and salt for the Vermont winters. Chonko grabbed an old rusty iron scythe and used it to strike Colleen, who howled and vanished.

## Protecting the Family
Rattled, Willie had a hard time breathing without his inhaler and his parents were very concerned. Asha darted upstairs to grab it from his bedside, and brought it down to the garage to get his asthma under control.

The hunters began to strategize about how they might be able to use the salt and rusty iron tools to protect the family, offering to create a salt ring or pile to keep the family safe from Colleen. Paul loudly protested, and accused the hunters of being charlatans since they had never seen any activity like this until the hunters themselves showed up. 

The hunters plead their case, and eventually Rebecca put a hand on Paul's shoulder and assured him that there wouldn't be any harm in stRebeccang on a pile of snow salt until the hunters figure out how to open the door and get them out of the house.

Chonko sensed that the negative feeling surrounding the monster was at its weakest in the basement. The hunters investigated the basement and found that it was full of old junk, cobwebs, and a very old floor with some dirt patches.

The three hunters poured a salt pile on the basement floor for the family to stand on while they investigate the house further. Dullface stayed behind to watch the family as the other two go upstairs to try and find more items to fight with and more information about the situation.

## Exploring the House

Asha and Chonko went back to the garage to find more iron objects to use as weapons. When they arrived, they moved towards a rusty shovel that sprang into the air and rocketed towards them. Asha deftly stepped aside and missed it completely, and Chonko was able to quickly to pull out her knife just in time to deflect the shovel from embedding itself in her leg. This was the event that Chonko had seen in the premonition, and Chonko prevented it from coming to pass. It did, however, cause both the knife and shovel to break.

The two hunters climbed to the attic after remembering that [Damian Keefe](Bystanders/Damian%20Keefe.md) was discovered in the attic. Once there,  Chonko attempted to use _the sight_ to find anything noteworthy, but was not successful. The hunters did notice that as they get to the higher floors, the sounds of rat activity got louder around them.

In an attempt to get outside help, Asha used her phone to go online and ask for information from her _net friends._ She revealed to the other hunters that the people she reached out to aren't just friends, but act more as religious followers who greatly revere her. They see her as someone who will play an important role in transporting humanity's consciousness into the cosmos, transcending our physical bodies.

Unfortunately, when Asha asked them for help about how to deal with the trouble at 120 Westview Place, they were perplexed. They assumed her account had been hacked and refused to provide any information for the rest of the day. 

In the basement, [Dullface](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Dullface.md) noticed that the already quiet squeaking of the rats was even quieter now that the other hunters had gone upstairs. He also remembered that in the living room there was a fireplace with tools possibly made of iron.

Dullface recklessly left the family alone to try and grab a fireplace poker. However, like before, the poker flew into the air and straight at Dullface's head. Unable to dodge or deflect it, Dullface is forced to choose between taking a hit from the blunt end or the slightly pointed end of the tool. After being struck by the blunt handle, Dullface cried out in pain and was knocked unconscious. Asha heard Dullface's cry and ran downstairs to help, leaving Chonko in the attic.

Chonko again attempted to use _the sight_ in the attic, and discovered the far more docile ghost of [Damian Keefe](Bystanders/Damian%20Keefe.md). Damian revealed that he had killed Colleen, and that "no part of her has ever left this house."

## The Situation Comes into Focus

 Upon discovering Dullface laying unconscious, Asha secured the fireplace poker in order to defend against attack. She swang wildly around the room with the iron poker, but the only result was the sound of a woman's laughter echoing through the house. 
 
They were shortly joined by Chonko, who explained what she learned from Damian's ghost. In an attempt to rouse Dullface, Chonko dumped the pitcher of lemonade on him - splashing sticky sweet lemonade everywhere. From behind the fireplace, under the couch, and every nook and cranny in the room, the rats surged forth attracted by the smell and jumped wildly at the pitcher in Chonko's hands. Chonko dropped the pitcher before they reached her, and the rats fled from the shattered glass down into the basement towards the Herberts.
 
The hunters chased after the rats to defend the family, only to find that the rats were leaving them unharmed - though they were swarming over the room in a huge circle. Rats walked over the salt pile without effect, but did not appear to be aggressive.

Asha used her .38 revolver and fired a shot at the floor between the family and the staircase, causing the rats to disperse into the shadows. The family fled back up the stairs, leaving the hunters to look around in the basement. Based on the behavior of the rats, the hunters suspected that [Colleen Keefe](Monster/Colleen%20Keefe.md)'s body was in the basement.

## Endgame

After investigating the basement, the hunters saw a bundle of cloth stored in the rafters. Asha retrieved it, and unraveled it to find a plastic beach umbrella and a few rats who scurried away.
From upstairs, they hear the sound of two women screaming.

After rushing to the top of the stairs, the hunters find that the family had tried again to enter the garage but their path was blocked when [Colleen Keefe](Monster/Colleen%20Keefe.md) ripped the floorboards out from under them and created barricades at the door. As Colleen howled at the family, she pointed a withered finger back towards the basement. From the gaps in the floorboards, the rats gushed out and began to climb up Paul's leg. 

Digging deep within, [Dullface](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Dullface.md) used _telekinesis_ to lock the rat swarm in position so the family could escape - rupturing a vessel in his head and suffering a nosebleed in the process. Colleen blinked out of view and the hunters traveled back downstairs to try and again locate [Colleen Keefe](Monster/Colleen%20Keefe.md)'s body.

Back in the basement, the hunters noticed three large wine casks stacked in a pyramid in a corner that look like they have not been touched in decades. Asha went over to one of them and struck it with the fireplace poker. The cask ruptured, but the poker broke in the process. From the cask flowed a powerfully smelling strong odor of brandy.

With the haft of the scythe, Chonko smashed another cask. Instead of brandy, this cask contained a moldering pile of cloth and human remains. The hunters debated how to best give the remains a proper burial. Asha _empathized_ with Colleen, and got an impression of relief, but also impatience and frustration. Again wielding the iron scythe, Chonko struck the bones, though to no effect. After _tuning in_ to Colleen, Chonko gleaned that Colleen considered the hunters' confusion to be its biggest threat.

The hunters decide to lift the final cask and smash it over the cask with the bones, splashing brandy into the ground, as well as scattering alcohol-soaked wood around the remains. With a flick of his wrist, Dullface tossed his "cigarette" lighter to Asha, who ignited the puddle of brandy.

The house shook and the largest swarm of rats yet erupted from everywhere, causing the hunters and Herberts to flee towards the front door. With Dullface at the lead and rats at their feet, they flung open the door to the outside. Colleen's spirit flew out behind them off into the sky.

# Notes for the Future

- [Asha](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Asha.md)'s net friends/followers believe that her account has been hacked. This may have future implications if they believe her integrity has also been compromised. 
- [Dullface](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Dullface.md) found the idea of [Asha](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Asha.md)'s belief system to be very appealing
- [Mr. Miata](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Mr.%20Miata.md) utilized a luck point, and the next time he _deals with the Agency_ there will be a lot of red tape.
- [Chonko](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Chonko.md) learned that _the sight_ may allow her to view "other side." This "other side" is not strictly the other side of death, but perhaps it is connected to her otherworld alter-ego, [[Others/Koncho\|../../Others/Koncho]].
- [Lady Squatch](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Lady%20Squatch.md) established that teleportation does not literally require angel wings, but vanished at a very inopportune moment - arousing additional suspicion from [Dullface](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Dullface.md).

# Reflections
[Colleen Keefe](Monster/Colleen%20Keefe.md) was weak to salt and iron - but not steel. The hunters could have used the salt itself as a weapon. Alternatively, if they had spread salt on the bones it would have caused all spooky activity in the house to stop - but not opened the door. 

Speaking as the ghost of Damian, the Keeper did not provide very clear information to the hunters about how Colleen's remains were related to her being trapped in the house. The hunters figured it out anyway.


# Character Development
- What do [Asha](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Asha.md) and [Chonko](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Chonko.md)'s knives look like?
- What does [Lady Squatch](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Lady%20Squatch.md)'s armor look like?
