## Name

The rats
Possessed Rat Swarm

## Summary
[Colleen Keefe](../Monster/Colleen%20Keefe.md)'s bond with her house extended to the rats that live inside it and the fields nearby. They saw what she saw and vice versa. 

The rats would swarm and do her bidding. There were so many of them, they sounded like a room full of squeaking machinery.
