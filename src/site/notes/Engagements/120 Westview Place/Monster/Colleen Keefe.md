# Colleen Keefe

## Name
---- 
Colleen Keefe
"The Ghost"

## Summary
---
Colleen Keefe was a ghost with unfinished business. To the outside world, she went missing - but that's not what happened. She was desperate to be laid to rest, and didn't understand why people wouldn't help her. She saw anyone who wasn't helping her accomplish her goal as complicit in the crime against her. She wanted to punish all who were complicit, including the hunters if they wouldn't help.


### Notes
Colleen had only one obsession: being properly laid to rest. As she had lost much of her humanity, she couldn't communicate with people directly. This infuriated her, and this frustration caused her to lash out violently.  She would kill anyone that didn't help her in a way she deemed sufficient. 

The Herberts had been there the longest before the hunters arrived, so she decided to kill them.

Colleen had not completely forgotten her own name, but it would have taken some work to reveal her humanity.

## Motivations
â€¢ **Executioner** (to punish the guilty)

## Appearance
- The ghost of a woman in her thirties. Wild hair, hollow eyes, spooky.
- Period clothing from the time of her death

## Powers
- Ethereal: Colleen is not corporeal or part of the mortal plane, so attacks with solid objects did affect her. Only iron, magic, or salt could affect her.
- [The Rats](../Minions/The%20Rats.md): Colleen could control a huge swarm of rats
- Telekinesis: Colleen could move, hold, throw and manipulate objects with her mind. She could strike the hunters with objects.
- Teleportation: Colleen could vanish and reappear anywhere in the house at will

## Weaknesses
- Her remains tied her to this mortal plane. 
- Her House. Her connection is so strong that the hunters could have harmed the house and she would feel it. If the house was destroyed, she would be destroyed as well.
- Colleen was vulnerable to salt, iron or magic. But any "deaths" after her first would not stick until she was properly laid to rest or her body destroyed. 

## Attacks
- **Telekinesis**: 2 to 4 harm close (she would grab objects and strike people with them)
## Armor
- None, but only attacks using salt, iron, or magic could harm her at all

## Harm Capacity
- 7 Total, but only if her remains had already been laid to rest
