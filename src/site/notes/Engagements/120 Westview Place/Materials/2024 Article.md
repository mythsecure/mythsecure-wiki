SHAFTSBURY, VT - 2024

City Slickers Meet Country Spooks: The Herberts’ Haunted Homestead!

> In a twist that could only happen in the quiet town of Shaftsbury, VT, the Herberts, fresh off the boat from the concrete jungle of New York City, have moved into the infamous Keefe house. Paul, a web designer who’s more used to dealing with bugs in code than bugs in the attic, and Rebecca, a lawyer who’s traded her court briefs for country life, are finding that country living isn’t as peaceful as they thought!
> 
> The Herberts have been reporting strange occurrences since they moved in. From eerie whispers in the night to the chilling sight of their morning coffee stirring itself, it seems the ghost of Damian Keefe might be less than thrilled with his new roommates. 
> 
> But Paul, ever the skeptic, isn’t buying it. “I don’t believe in ghosts,” he scoffed, “It’s probably just the house settling. Or maybe the old place just has rats.” Rebecca, on the other hand, is keeping an open mind. “It’s just another negotiation. I’m sure we’ll reach an agreement soon.” As they adjust to their new life, one thing’s for sure: the Herberts’ tale of city mice in a haunted country house is giving the locals plenty to talk about!
> 
> So, whether it’s city lights or country frights, the Herberts are in for an adventure. And as for the rest of us? We’ll be here, popcorn in hand, ready for the next update from the most haunted house in Shaftsbury!
