## Name
----
 Shaftsbury, VT is a town that the Herbert family moved to in order to get away from the hustle and bustle of NYC.

## Summary
The focus of the story is the [[One-Off Engagements/120 Westview Place/Locations/Keefe House\|Keefe House]], not the town. The team didn't go into the session with the idea that the town would play much of a role.
