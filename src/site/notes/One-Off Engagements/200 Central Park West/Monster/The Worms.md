# The Worms

## Name
The Worms
_Bipalium Harrisoni_

## Summary
---
The hunters faced these monsters during their investigation of [[One-Off Engagements/200 Central Park West/Session History - 200 Central Park West\|200 Central Park West]].

Three worm hatchlings of a newly discovered species. They are really fast and slithery.  Their bite is poisonous and they spit venom. They can create electricity, but must rest between charges. 

They want to feed, usually as a pack.  They prefer live prey, they will try to inhabit and eat the taxidermy animals of the museum.

No face, no nose, no eyes. Just a mouth with teeth like a lamprey or leech. Smells of ozone, strongest when it uses lightning. The worms cannot be captured, they will always escape. The hunters will have to kill them.

Since they are from a very dry area, water harms them. The worms are so rubbery and flexible inside that it is hard to hit sensitive organs. They heal, unless damaged by water.

## Motivations
---
â€¢ **Beast** (to run wild, destroying and killing)

## Appearance
- Each one is only about as wide across as the short side of a credit card and the length of an adult's forearm.
- Bright red, like a salami.

## Powers
**Poison**: When someone is bitten or otherwise gets poison into their body, they take 1 harm every 5 minutes until the area is rinsed with water or a water-like substance like tea or soda. The worms can spit this poison, or administer it via bite. Simply touching the poison causes 1 harm.

**Electricity**: The worms can naturally generate electricity. If they attack someone/something with it, the victim is stunned. The worms can use this to escape, and they must rest after emitting a charge. The electrical powers can also fry electronics and interfere with EMF.


## Weaknesses
- Water

Water acts as a venom that the hunters can use to coat their normal attacks.
Not especially vulnerable to magic/holy damage - only water.

## Attacks
- **Poison Bite:** 4 harm hand/close poison
- **Electric Zap:** 3-harm close electricity stun

## Armor
0

## Harm Capacity
Each has 5 harm
