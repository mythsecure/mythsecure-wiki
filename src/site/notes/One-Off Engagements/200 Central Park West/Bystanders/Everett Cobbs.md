# Everett Cobbs
---
## Name
Everett Cobbs

## Background/Purpose
Everett is an apparatchik who is petty and just wants everyone to follow the rules.

He will be suspicious of the hunters, and is annoyed with [Dr. Rosana Lombardo](Dr.%20Rosana%20Lombardo.md) for calling them in the first place.

He outranks [Dr. Kate Harrison](../Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md) and [Dr. Rosana Lombardo](Dr.%20Rosana%20Lombardo.md), and outranked the [Deceased Researchers](Deceased%20Researchers.md). 

As an administrator, he does not know about science. He was the one who mistook the late Dr. Harris Sun for [Dr. Kate Harrison](../Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md).

Everett got his job because his late father was a trustee. Everett Cobbs Sr. was friends with [Dr. Rosana Lombardo](Dr.%20Rosana%20Lombardo.md), who respected him. Everett Jr. is more of an entitled snot.
