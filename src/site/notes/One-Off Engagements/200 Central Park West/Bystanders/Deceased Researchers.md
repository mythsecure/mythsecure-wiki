# Deceased Researchers
---
## Name

Professor Natasha Quigley
Dr. Harris Sun
Annette Tapper

## Background
These researchers were killed by [The Worms](../Monster/The%20Worms.md). They worked in the Asian People's Department as Anthropologists. Recently returned from a trip with [Dr. Kate Harrison](../Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md) to the Steppe.

They know very little. All they know is that they were unpacking some artifacts and then the screaming began. First, they heard the voice of [Dr. Kate Harrison](../Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md) and then Professor Quigley started convulsing.

## Appearance
Academic types, but dead.
