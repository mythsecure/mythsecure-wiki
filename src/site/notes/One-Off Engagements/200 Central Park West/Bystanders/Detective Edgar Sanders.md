# Detective Edgar Sanders
---
## Name

Detective Edgar Sanders


## Background
Det. Sanders is familiar with the police report and the facts of the case. He was interested in getting information out of [Dr. Kate Harrison](../Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md).

Reluctantly tolerated the hunters, to a point.

Won't fight. Might try to take a shot at the worms, but will lose and possibly die.  

Insists on being called Detective, not Officer. Not Edgar

## Appearance
- Stocky, bald white middle-aged man in a cheap suit.
- About as wide as he is tall, built like a tree stump.
- Shiny bald head



## Motivations
---

- **Detective** (to rule out explanations)
- **Busybody** (to interfere with other people's plans)
