# Dr. Kate Harrison
---
## Name

Dr. Kate Harrison

## Background/Purpose
Dr. Harrison has an unhealthy obsession to study [The Worms](../Monster/The%20Worms.md). At least one. She will attempt to sabotage the hunters from killing any of them and will need to be persuaded to allow them.

If need be, she will use physical force to overpower the hunters and let the worms escape.

The worms will not be captured. The hunters will have to kill them.

Dr. Harrison was on an expedition with the [Deceased Researchers](../Bystanders/Deceased%20Researchers.md), but worked as a biologist rather than an anthropologist. She was sent by mistake instead of Doctor Harris Sun (one of the [Deceased Researchers](../Bystanders/Deceased%20Researchers.md))

## Appearance
