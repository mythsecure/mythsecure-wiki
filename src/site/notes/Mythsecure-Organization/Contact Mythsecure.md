# Contact Mythsecure

## Overview
As all of the hunters are part of Mythsecure, they can all contact the agency for assistance. However, since not all hunters use the Professional playbook, there are two variations of this move.

While the Professional has an easier time using this move, it does not imply that they are any kind of squad leader or otherwise receive preferential treatment.

>[!warning] 
> In both versions of the move, the organizational properties apply on both failures and successes. 
> **Positives:** Good Intel, Weird Tech Gadgets
> **Negatives:** Bureaucratic, Interdepartmental Rivalry



## Contact Mythsecure - Professional

**Deal with the Agency - Professional:** *When you deal with the agency as the team's designated contact, requesting help or gear, or making excuses for a failure, roll +Sharp.* 
	*- On a 10+, you’re good! Your request for gear or personnel is okayed, or your slip-up goes unnoticed.*
	*- On a 7-9, things aren’t so great. You might get chewed out by your superiors and there’ll be fallout, but you get what you need for the job.* 
	*- On a miss, you screwed up: you might be suspended or under investigation, or just in the doghouse. You certainly aren’t going to get any help until you sort it all out.*


## Contact Mythsecure -  Team Member

**Deal with the Agency - Team Member:** When you deal with the agency while not the team's designated contact, requesting help or gear, or making excuses for a failure, ignore your Sharp stat and roll as follows:

- If a hunter has a sharp value of 0, +1, +2, +3, roll _-1 (minus one)_.
- If a hunter has negative sharp, roll _-2 (minus two)_.

Then follow the roll result as described in the Professional move above. Hunters may spend a point of luck to get an automatic success.
