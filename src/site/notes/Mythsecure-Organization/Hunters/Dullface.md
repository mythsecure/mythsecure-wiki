## Moves

### Playbook Moves

- **Let’s Get Out Of Here!**: *If you can protect someone by telling them what to do, or by leading them out, roll +Charm instead of +Tough.*

- **The Power of Heart:** *When fighting a monster, if you help someone, don’t roll +Cool. You automatically help as though you’d rolled a 10.*

- **What Could Go Wrong?**: *Whenever you charge into immediate danger without hedging your bets, hold 2. You may spend your hold to:*
	- *Inflict +1 harm.* 
	- *Reduce someone’s harm suffered by 1.* 
	-  *Take +2 forward on an act under pressure roll*

- **Oops!:** *If you want to stumble across something important, tell the Keeper. You will find something important and useful, although not necessarily related to your immediate problems.*

### Alternate Weird Move - Telekinesis

>[!warning]
> An alternate weird move means the hunter cannot [[Rules/Use Magic\|Use Magic]]. However, they can still attempt a [[Rules/Weird Work\|Weird Work]].

*When you fling something with your mind, roll +Weird:* 
- *On a 10+, you move it. Choose two options and mark 1-harm.*
- *On a 7-9, you move it but it hurts. Choose one option and mark 2-harm.* 
- *On a miss, something goes horribly wrong.* 

*By default you can move something smaller than a person. You don’t have much control, and you can’t move it strongly enough to hurt anything.* 

*Telekinesis options (anything not picked is not true):* 
- *Something is held fast.* 
- *Something is hurt (2-harm smash).* 
- *Something catches fire.* 
 - *You can fling something bigger than a person.*
 - *You keep it basically under your control.*
- *You suffer 1 less harm.* 

*Advanced: When you advance your telekinesis move, add this:*
- *On a 12+, choose three options. You may also choose from these advanced options:*

	- *Something explodes (3-harm close fire area messy)* 
	- *Something implodes (3-harm close crush) • Lots of stuff is flying under your control.* 
	- *You have perfect and precise control over exactly what happens*

### Company Move

**Contact Mythsecure - Team Member:** When you deal with the agency while not the team's designated contact, requesting help or gear, or making excuses for a failure, ignore your Sharp stat and roll as follows:

- If a hunter has a sharp value of 0, +1, +2, +3, roll _-1 (minus one)_.
- If a hunter has negative sharp, roll _-2 (minus two)_.

- On a 10+, you’re good! Your request for gear or personnel is okayed, or your slip-up goes unnoticed.
	- On a 7-9, things aren’t so great. You might get chewed out by your superiors and there’ll be fallout, but you get what you need for the job. 
	- On a miss, you screwed up: you might be suspended or under investigation, or just in the doghouse. You certainly aren’t going to get any help until you sort it all out.
