# Moves

**Let’s Get Out Of Here!**: If you can protect someone by telling them what to do, or by leading them out, roll +Charm instead of +Tough.

**The Power of Heart:** When fighting a monster, if you help someone, don’t roll +Cool. You automatically help as though you’d rolled a 10.

**What Could Go Wrong?**: Whenever you charge into immediate danger without hedging your bets, hold 2. You may spend your hold to: • Inflict +1 harm. • Reduce someone’s harm suffered by 1. • Take +2 forward on an act under pressure roll

# Alternate Weird Move
**Telekinesis**

When you fling something with your mind, roll +Weird: 
• On a 10+, you move it. Choose two options and mark 1-harm.
• On a 7-9, you move it but it hurts. Choose one option and mark 2-harm. 
• On a miss, something goes horribly wrong. 

By default you can move something smaller than a person. You don’t have much control, and you can’t move it strongly enough to hurt anything. 

Telekinesis options (anything not picked is not true): 
• Something is held fast. 
• Something is hurt (2-harm smash). 
• Something catches fire. 
• You can fling something bigger than a person. • You keep it basically under your control.
• You suffer 1 less harm. 

advanced: When you advance your telekinesis move, add this:
• On a 12+, choose three options. You may also choose from these advanced options:

• Something explodes (3-harm close fire area messy) 
• Something implodes (3-harm close crush) • Lots of stuff is flying under your control. 
• You have perfect and precise control over exactly what happens


# Gear

- Cricket bat (2-harm hand innocuous messy)
