# Moves

- **The Sight:** You can see the invisible, especially spirits and magical influences. You may communicate with (maybe even make deals with) the spirits you see, and they give you more opportunities to spot clues when you investigate a mystery

- **Premonitions:** At the start of each mystery, roll +Weird. 
	- On a 10+, you get a detailed vision of something bad that is yet to happen. You take +1 forward to prevent it coming true, and mark experience if you stop it. 
	- On a 7-9+ you get clouded images of something bad that is yet to happen: mark experience if you stop it.
	- On a miss, you get a vision of something bad happening to you and the Keeper holds 3, to be spent one-for-one as penalties to rolls you make.
	
- **Tune in:**  You can attune your mind to a monster or minion. Roll +Weird. 
	- On a 10+, hold 3. 
	- On a 7-9, hold 1. 
	- On a miss, the monster becomes aware of you.
	
	Spend one hold to ask the Keeper one of the following questions, and gain +1 ongoing while acting on the answers: 
	- Where is the creature right now?
	- What is it planning to do right now? 
	- Who is it going to attack next?
	- Who does it regard as the biggest threat? 
	- How can I attract its attention?

# Storyline
## Dark Side
- Secrets
- Dark Bargain
- Paranoia

The Keeper can ask you to do nasty things (in accordance with the tags), when your powers need you to. If you do whatever is asked, mark experience. If you don’t do it, then your powers are unavailable until the end of the mystery (or until you cave). As you mark off Luck boxes, these requests will get bigger and nastier.

Bargain with the Koncho, the dark version. Who lives in an alternate timeline
