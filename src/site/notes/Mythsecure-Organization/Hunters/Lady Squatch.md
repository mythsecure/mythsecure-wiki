## Description

### Appearance
Lady Squatch looks like Sasquatch, because she is a Sasquatch. She doesn't have any magical disguise or deception to pass as a human. She just obviously looks like a sasquatch a la the [[https://web.archive.org/web/20250215221914/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterson%E2%80%93Gimlin_film\|Patterson Film.]] People just don't seem to care ðŸ¤·

Lady Squatch wears armor which looks like a rumpled suit. It has big shoulder pads and a swooping lapel. It looks like it was absolutely the height of fashion in the 80s but has never been washed.

She has plenty of [personality](https://web.archive.org/web/20250219165737/https://www.tiktok.com/@bigfoot_bae/video/7468070463663541546) and [style](https://web.archive.org/web/20250219170325/https://www.tiktok.com/@bigfoot_bae/video/7291657163569777962), as anyone can clearly see.
### Development
#### Mission
Lady Squatch has been exiled by the Squatch Masters. She must work for the cause of Good without drawing attention from your brothers and sisters, as they are bound to execute you for your crimes.

She has been dead before, but was reincarnated as a Squatchy angel.

Lady Squatch has determined that [[Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Chonko\|Chonko]] is "at heart, a good and righteous person. [She] must help them stay that way"

## Moves

- **Angel Wings**: *You can go instantly to anywhere youâ€™ve visited before, or to a person you know well. When you carry one or two people with you, roll +Weird.*
	- *On a 10+ you all go where you wanted.* 
	- *On a 7-9, you donâ€™t quite manage it. Either you are all separated, or you all appear in the wrong place.*
	- *On a miss, nothing happens. You can't try again for a little while.*

- **What I Need, When I Need It**: *You may store any small object you own, putting it into a magical space nobody can get to. You may retrieve anything you stored at any time; it appears in your hand.*

- **Soothe:** *When you talk to someone for a few seconds in a quiet voice, you can calm them down, blocking any panic, anger, or other negative emotions they have. This works even if the thing that freaked them out is still present, as long as your voice can be heard.*


### Alternate Weird Move - Illuminated

*When you telepathically ask the Secret Masters for aid, roll +Weird:*
- *On a 10+, the Secret Masters reveal a key fact, clue, or technique that will help you.*
- *On a 7-9, the Secret Masters need you to complete a task for them. Once it is done, they reveal a key fact, clue, or technique that will help you.* 
- *On a miss, the Secret Mastersâ€™ reply is terrible, garbled, or somehow dangerously wrong.* 
- *Advanced: On a 12+, the Secret Masters reveal a key fact, clue, or technique that will help you. You may ask one follow-up question that the Keeper will answer honestly*
