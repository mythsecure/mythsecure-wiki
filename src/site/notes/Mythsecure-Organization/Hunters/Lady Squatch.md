# Moves
- **Angel Wings**: You can go instantly to anywhere you’ve visited before, or to a person you know well. When you carry one or two people with you, roll +Weird.
	- On a 10+ you all go where you wanted. 
	- On a 7-9, you don’t quite manage it. Either you are all separated, or you all appear in the wrong place.
	- On a miss, nothing happens. You can't try again for a little while.
- **What I Need, When I Need It**: You may store any small object you own, putting it into a magical space nobody can get to. You may retrieve anything you stored at any time; it appears in your hand.
- **Soothe:** When you talk to someone for a few seconds in a quiet voice, you can calm them down, blocking any panic, anger, or other negative emotions they have. This works even if the thing that freaked them out is still present, as long as your voice can be heard.


# Alternate Weird Move
**Illuminated**

When you telepathically ask the Secret Masters for aid, roll +Weird:
- On a 10+, the Secret Masters reveal a key fact, clue, or technique that will help you.
- On a 7-9, the Secret Masters need you to complete a task for them. Once it is done, they reveal a key fact, clue, or technique that will help you. 
- On a miss, the Secret Masters’ reply is terrible, garbled, or somehow dangerously wrong. 
- Advanced: On a 12+, the Secret Masters reveal a key fact, clue, or technique that will help you. You may ask one follow-up question that the Keeper will answer honestly
