## Description

### Appearance

Asha is a 14 year old girl with a thoughtful expression. She is unusually tall for my age, and towers over her peers and many adults at 6' 1" . She inherited her height from her father who is towering in height and is a broad wall of a man. Her overall appearance exudes strength but her baby face reveals her youthful vulnerability. Her androgynous look means she can effortlessly transition between  femininity and boyish charm. Depending on how she styles her hair and which clothes she wears, she can easily pass as a young man. She has a small but distinct birthmark in the shape of comet entering earth's atmosphere on the nape of her neck. It's subtle most of the time, but seems to shimmer in certain light.

### Development
#### Asha's "Cult"
During the events at [[One-Off Engagements/120 Westview Place/Session History - 120 Westview Place\|120 Westview Place]], Asha revealed that she has a following that believes she will help usher in a new era for humanity using artificial intelligence. These followers serve as her _net friends_, though they are not blindly obedient and may take some convincing before providing help on demand. 

This was evident when Asha contacted her followers to ask for help with [[One-Off Engagements/120 Westview Place/Monster/Colleen Keefe\|Colleen Keefe]], but they didn't understand why their leader was off hunting "ghosts" and believed her account had been hacked. Since then, Asha explained the situation and smoothed out the matter with her followers. (Forgiven as described in [[Campaign/Campaign Details\|Campaign Details]]).

## Moves

- **See, It All Fits Together**: You can use Sharp instead of Charm when you manipulate someone
- **Net Friends**: You know a lot of people on the Internet. When you contact a net friend to help you with a mystery, roll +Charm. 
	- On a 10+, they’re available and helpful—they can fix something, break a code, hack a computer, or get you some special information.
	- On a 7-9, they’re prepared to help, but it’s either going to take some time or you’re going to have to do part of it yourself. 
	- On a miss, you burn some bridges
	
- **Sneaky**: When you attack from ambush, or from behind, inflict +2 harm


### Alternate Weird Move - Empath


*When you open up your brain to feel the emotions of something right there in front of you, roll +Weird:*
- *On a 10+, you gain a clear impression of their current emotional state and intentions. Take +1 forward when acting on this knowledge.*
- *On a 7-9, you gain a hazy impression of their current emotional state and intentions.*
- *On a miss, your brain is overwhelmed with emotion.* 
- *Advanced: On a 12+, you get an impression (as for 10 or more), and you may ask one follow-up question that the Keeper will answer honestly.* 

*You can use empath on anything with emotions, but the less human they are, the less it’s safe for you. If the emotions are especially strong or alien, you might need to act under pressure.*
