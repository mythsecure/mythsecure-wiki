# Moves

- **See, It All Fits Together**: You can use Sharp instead of Charm when you manipulate someone
- **Net Friends**: You know a lot of people on the Internet. When you contact a net friend to help you with a mystery, roll +Charm. 
	- On a 10+, they’re available and helpful—they can fix something, break a code, hack a computer, or get you some special information.
	- On a 7-9, they’re prepared to help, but it’s either going to take some time or you’re going to have to do part of it yourself. 
	- On a miss, you burn some bridges
	
- **Sneaky**: When you attack from ambush, or from behind, inflict +2 harm


# Alternate Weird Move
**Empath** 

When you open up your brain to feel the emotions of something right there in front of you, roll +Weird:
- On a 10+, you gain a clear impression of their current emotional state and intentions. Take +1 forward when acting on this knowledge.
- On a 7-9, you gain a hazy impression of their current emotional state and intentions.
- On a miss, your brain is overwhelmed with emotion. 
- Advanced: On a 12+, you get an impression (as for 10 or more), and you may ask one follow-up question that the Keeper will answer honestly. 

You can use empath on anything with emotions, but the less human they are, the less it’s safe for you. If the emotions are especially strong or alien, you might need to act under pressure.

# Storyline

> I'm 14 year old girl with a thoughtful expression. I'm unusually tall for my age, and tower over my peers and most adults. I inherited my height from my father who is towering in height and is a broad wall of a man. My overall appearance exudes strength but my baby face reveals my youthful vulnerability. My androgynous look means I can effortlessly transition between my femininity and boyish charm. Depending on how I style my hair and which clothes I wear, I can easily pass as a young man. I have a small but distinct birthmark in the shape of comet entering earth's atmosphere on the nape of my neck. It's subtle most of the time, but seems to shimmer in certain light.
