## Description

### Appearance
A man with a determined face and a shabby suit.

### Development
#### The Agency: MythSecure
While all of the hunters work for MythSecure, Mr. Miata is a company man. He is the designated company contact for the team when in the field, but is not a outright the team manager. Anyone can try to contact the agency (such as [[Mythsecure-Organization/Personnel/Daniel Evers\|Daniel Evers]]) during a mission, but Mr. Miata has the highest chances of success.

**MythSecure**, as an organization has positives:
- Good Intel
- Weird Tech Gadgets

But also negatives:
- Bureaucratic
- Interdepartmental Rivalry

## Moves

### Playbook Moves

- **Battlefield Awareness**: You always know what’s happening around you, and what to watch out for. Take +1 armor (max 2-armor) on top of whatever you get from your gear. 

- **Leave No One Behind**: *In combat, when you help someone escape, roll +Sharp.* 
	- *On a 10+ you get them out clean.*
	- *On a 7-9, you can either get them out or suffer no harm, you choose.* 
	- *On a miss, you fail to get them out and you’ve attracted hostile attention*

- **Mobility**: *You have a truck, van, or car built for monster hunting. Choose two good things and one bad thing about it.*
	- Good: Fast, gear
	- Bad: Loud

- **Contact Mythsecure - Professional: *When you deal with the agency, requesting help or gear, or making excuses for a failure, roll +Sharp.* 
	- *On a 10+, you’re good—your request for gear or personnel is okayed, or your slip-up goes unnoticed.*
	- *On a 7-9, things aren’t so great. You might get chewed out by your superiors and there’ll be fallout, but you get what you need for the job.* 
	- *On a miss, you screwed up: you might be suspended or under investigation, or just in the doghouse. You certainly aren’t going to get any help until you sort it all out.*
	- As the designated company contact, Mr. Miata has an easier time using this move than the other hunters, as described in [[Mythsecure-Organization/Contact Mythsecure\|Contact Mythsecure]].

### Alternate Weird Move - Empath

>[!warning]
> An alternate weird move means the hunter cannot [[Rules/Use Magic\|Use Magic]] However, they can still attempt a [[Rules/Weird Work\|Weird Work]].

*When you open up your brain to feel the emotions of something right there in front of you, roll +Weird:*
- *On a 10+, you gain a clear impression of their current emotional state and intentions. Take +1 forward when acting on this knowledge.*
- *On a 7-9, you gain a hazy impression of their current emotional state and intentions.*
- *On a miss, your brain is overwhelmed with emotion.* 
- *Advanced: On a 12+, you get an impression (as for 10 or more), and you may ask one follow-up question that the Keeper will answer honestly.* 

*You can use empath on anything with emotions, but the less human they are, the less it’s safe for you. If the emotions are especially strong or alien, you might need to act under pressure.*
