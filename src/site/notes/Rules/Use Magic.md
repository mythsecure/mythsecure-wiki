# Use Magic

> [!quote] Citation Note
> This move is adapted from the official [Monster of the Week Rules](https://web.archive.org/web/20250215142209/https://evilhat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Monster-of-the-Week-Reference-Sheets-Consolidated-1.pdf).

## Overview

Hunters (**that have not selected an alternate weird move**) use magic to affect the world around them in weird ways. 

>[!warning]
> Selecting an alternate weird move means the hunter cannot [[Rules/Use Magic\|Use Magic]]. However, they can still attempt a [[Rules/Weird Work\|Weird Work]].

## Mechanics 

When you **use magic**, say what you’re trying to achieve and how you do the spell, then roll +Weird.
- If you get a 10+, the magic works without issues: choose your effect.
- On a 7-9, it works imperfectly: choose your effect and a glitch. The Keeper will decide what effect the glitch has.
- On a miss, you lose control of the magic. This never ends well.

By default the magic has one of the effects listed below, **lasts for around thirty minutes**, and does not expose you to danger, unwanted attention, or side-effects. 

If there’s a glitch that might change.

### Effects
**These effects last for about 30 minutes**

- Inflict harm (1-harm ignore-armor magic obvious).
- Enchant a weapon. It gets +1 harm and +magic.
- _Do one thing that is beyond human limitations (SEE BELOW)_
- Bar a place or portal to a specific person or a type of creature.
- Trap a specific person, minion, or monster.
- Banish a spirit or curse from the person, object, or place it inhabits.
- Summon a monster into the world.
- Communicate with something that you do not share a language with.
- Observe another place or time.
- Heal 1-harm from an injury, or cure a disease, or neutralize a poison.

#### "One Thing Beyond Human Limitations"

This can mean anything, but it is limited by the universe's established rules for the hunter. For example, if a hunter has fire powers "one thing beyond human limitations" would apply to throwing fireballs but would not allow them to raise the dead without additional magical requirements.

This is up to the Keeper's discretion, but as usual players can plead their case.

### Glitches
- The effect is weakened.
- The effect is of short duration.
- You take 1-harm ignore-armour.
- The magic draws immediate, unwelcome attention.
- It has a problematic side effect.

## Magical Requirements

The Keeper may require one or more of the following:

- The spell requires weird materials.
- The spell will take 10 seconds, 30 seconds, or 1 minute to cast.
- The spell requires ritual chanting and gestures.
- The spell requires you to draw arcane symbols.
- You need one or two people to help cast the spell.
- You need to refer to a tome of magic for the details.
