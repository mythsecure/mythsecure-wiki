# Weird Work

>[!note] Mythsecure Note
> This is an adaptation of the original MotW's _Big Magic_ move.
> 
> **As the world progresses, the hunters may learn about Works that already exist.**

## Overview

Sometimes the everyday spells and rituals of the [[Rules/Use Magic\|Use Magic]] basic move aren’t enough. **Weird Works** cover everything more powerful, such as [[Weirdness/Works/Classic Resurrection\|bringing someone back from the dead]] or opening a portal to another dimension. Weird Works are both more powerful and more dangerous than the basic **use magic**.

Decide what magical effect you want to make happen, and tell the Keeper. They will determine what you must do in order to cast the spell. The options (and the Keeper can pick more than one) are:

- You need to spend a lot of time (days or weeks) researching the magic ritual.
- You need to experiment with the spell—there will be lots of failures before you get it right.
- You need some rare and weird ingredients and supplies.
- The spell will take a long time (hours or days) to cast.
- You need a lot of people (2, 3, 7, 13, or more) to help.
- The spell needs to be cast at a particular place and/or time.
- You need to [[Rules/Use Magic\|Use Magic]] as part of the ritual, perhaps to summon a monster, communicate with something, or bar the portal you opened.
- It will have a specific side-effect or danger.

Once you know the requirements, you need to arrange them. Once you’ve done that, the magical effect you want will simply happen. You don’t  necessarily need to roll any move for the Work itself, but you might need to roll some other moves, as you try to meet the requirements.

## Textbook Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use a **Weird Work**, but are not necessarily canon for the Mythsecure universe.

### Locate Someone
> The hunters want to discover where a particular person is, with only a photograph to go on. The Keeper decides this will require three people to take part in the ritual, and that they need a very precise map of the area—the spell will guide a pendulum to the person’s location.

### Banishment
> The hunters are investigating a frogbeast that’s been devouring people. After discovering it’s from an alien dimension, the hunters propose casting a spell that “detunes” it from our dimension and sends it home (or somewhere else, at least). The Keeper decides this will require a few experiments taking up the afternoon, the spell will take around six hours to cast, it requires them to [[Rules/Use Magic\|Use Magic]] to banish the frogbeast from this dimension, and it will expose them to danger—the frogbeast will feel the spell being cast and know where the force is coming from.

### Resurrection
This example describes a possible outcome of the work [[Weirdness/Works/Classic Resurrection\|Classic Resurrection]].
> One of the hunters on the team has died, and the others want to bring her back to life. The Keeper decides that it will take some weeks of research, the ritual requires her body, it must take place at dawn on the spring solstice in view of the rising sun, they must [[Rules/Use Magic\|Use Magic]] to summon back the dead hunter’s soul from Death’s realm, and it exposes them to a big danger—Death will be angered by this transgression.
