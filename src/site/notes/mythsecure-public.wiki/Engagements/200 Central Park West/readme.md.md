# Session History - 200 Central Park West


Date: 27 June 2024

---

>[!info]
> Keeper's Note: This session did not run smoothly as the Keeper tried to do too much. The character development portions of the story is canon, but due to the sloppy setup the Keeper evened out the playing field and made it something the players would get through - even if we had to bend the rules a little bit. 
> 
> As a result, the history is a summary and not exceptionally detailed. The hunters' advancements are not polished, and we need a better system to work on capturing roles, moves, and more. 
> 
> The Keeper and hunters did not capture details such as XP accurately.

# The Engagement

## Start-Of-Mystery Moves
[Chonko](Chonko.md) had a _premonition_ and saw a clouded image of something bad that had not yet transpired. The vision showed a friend clutching one eye and screaming in agony.

## Character Development

### Chonko's Character Development
Chonko explained that her "Dark Bargain" with [[mythsecure-public.wiki/Others/Koncho\|../../Others/Koncho]], her alter ego, is related to multiverses. All of Chonko's powers come from a connection to other realities where things are different, but that connection is a two way (or infinite way) street. When the bargain works in her favor, Chonko can retrieve great power from other universes. But the other realities may reach into Chonko's and steal reality for themselves.

### Lady Squatch's Character Development
Lady Squatch has always worn armor, which looks like a rumpled  suit. Big shoulder pads and a swooping lapel.  It looks like it was absolutely the height of fashion in the 80s.

The players decided that Lady Squatch appears like a sasquatch, but most people just don't really care. She does not look 100% human, she looks like the creature from the Patterson film.

### Dullface's Character Development
Dullface rides around on a skateboard, and also carries a blunt weapon. The player decided that the skateboard _is_ the weapon.

## Social Development

- [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md) is trying to keep [Chonko](Chonko.md) pure
- [Chonko](Chonko.md) hopes that [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md) can help her control her powers
- [Dullface](Dullface.md) is suspicious of [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md)'s intentions and worries that MS will hunt her someday

Chonko explained that the dark bargain that allows her to access otherworldliness works both ways. The other worlds can reach across and grab from her.

Lady Squatch comes from another world herself, and wants to prepare Chonko for dealing with it. They decide they are going to regular prayer/affirmation to help keep Chonko pure and anchored to this reality.

Dullface worries that the meditations/affirmations are secretly a way to steal Chonko's soul with voodoo black magic. Dullface distrusts Lady Squatch even more as a result of the time she spends with Chonko.

## Teaser/Background Information/Debrief

The hunters met at the office near Union Square, Manhattan. During their debrief, engagement manager [Daniel Evers](Daniel%20Evers) informed them about the situation with suspicious deaths at the American Museum of Natural History at 200 Central Park West. Daniel provided them with the [Police Report](Materials/Police%20Report.md):


[Daniel Evers](Daniel%20Evers) explained that the museum is closed and a police investigation is likely already underway. A [[mythsecure-public.wiki/Engagements/200 Central Park West/Bystanders/Dr. Rosana Lombardo\|Dr. Rosana Lombardo]] has called them to attend as private investigators, and requested that they meet at the main entrance at Theodore Roosevelt Rotunda on the 2nd floor.

Due to the fact that they were going to take the subway, Daniel advised that they do not have their weapons obviously displayed.

- [Chonko](Chonko.md) brought a shotgun and a big knife in a ratty old gym bag
- [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md) brought the razor whip, and stashed it in the magical suit pocket.
- [Dullface](Dullface.md) brought his nunchucks and skateboard

## Arrival at the Museum

The hunters arrived at the museum, and were let in at the main entrance by [Dr. Rosana Lombardo](Dr.%20Rosana%20Lombardo.md), a small woman in her mid-60s with coke bottle glasses on a chain around her neck and a Grandma sweater.

Inside the front door was an argument in progress with:

- [Everett Cobbs](Bystanders/Everett%20Cobbs.md) : a museum administrator
- [Detective Edgar Sanders](Bystanders/Detective%20Edgar%20Sanders.md): A stocky, bald white middle-aged man in a cheap suit with a cup of coffee. He was average height, but about as wide as he is tall.
- [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md): a museum biologist who stood a head taller than Det. Sanders and is built like a shot put athlete.

As the hunters approached with [Dr. Rosana Lombardo](Dr.%20Rosana%20Lombardo.md), Detective Sanders quietly turned to Dr. Harrison and says _"Look here, Man-hands, there is something here you're not telling me. If you don't cooperate I can get some uniforms in here to help persuade you by force._" Dr. Harrison did not back down and replies, _"Try me, Pig. I don't want to, but just know that I could roll your fat ass down those marble stairs with one hand tied behind my back."_


After introducing themselves and a brief conversation, it becomes clear that neither [Everett Cobbs](Bystanders/Everett%20Cobbs.md)  or [Detective Edgar Sanders](Bystanders/Detective%20Edgar%20Sanders.md) want the hunters around. [Dr. Rosana Lombardo](Dr.%20Rosana%20Lombardo.md) is able to calmly but firmly convince Chris to allow them in, albeit reluctantly. [Detective Edgar Sanders](Bystanders/Detective%20Edgar%20Sanders.md) is at first suspicious, but also respected [Dr. Rosana Lombardo](Dr.%20Rosana%20Lombardo.md)'s decision to welcome the hunters.

Dr. Lombardo explained that the victims were part of an anthropological expedition to a remote part of inland Asia, somewhere along the Russian-Mongolian border. There was a bureaucratic snafu (When explaining this, Dr. Lombardo glanced at [Everett Cobbs](Bystanders/Everett%20Cobbs.md)) that resulted in [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md)'s attendance on the trip in addition to Dr. Harris Sun. 

[Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md) explained that they made the best use of the trip they could, but did not spend time with the anthropologists as she was a biologist. [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md) tried to _investigate a mystery_ on [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md), but it failed. As a result, [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md) began to suspect that [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md) might not be a regular person.

[Dullface](Dullface.md) tried to charm [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md) into revealing more information, but it failed. Dr. Harrison interpreted the attempt as an unwanted romantic advance and firmly told Dullface that she was not interested.

Dr. Lombardo lead the hunters out of the Theodore Roosevelt rotunda towards Akeley Hall of African mammals in the direction of the room where the researchers were found dead.


## Akeley Hall of African Mammals

>[!Keeper's Note]
> From this point on, the keeper took poor notes. Most details are half-remembered recreations that only capture the broad strokes. They capture the big picture.

While walking towards the elevator through the hall of African Mammals, Dr. Harrison noticed that there was an elephant tusk laying on the ground. Chonko walked over to investigate, but then _acted under pressure_ to sense that a monstrous worm had leapt out of the taxidermy elephant and had tried to attack - narrowly dodging it.

The worm was about 1 1/2 feet long, and blood red like a salami. It had no face, no nose, no eyes. Just a mouth with teeth like a lamprey or leech..

Chonko leaned forward to start to attack the worm, but [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md) put a hand on Chonko's shoulder to stop her and whispered _"Wait!"_

[Dullface](Dullface.md) ran in to attack the worm, looping the rope of his nunchucks around it and pulling tight to cut into its skin. The worm was injured, but the smell of ozone filled the room and the worm delivered a powerful electric shock that stunned Dullface - causing him to drop the worm and the nunchucks. 

With two more rubbery slaps, two other worms fell out from the elephant exhibit onto the floor. One slithered incredibly fast towards [Dr. Rosana Lombardo](Dr.%20Rosana%20Lombardo.md), and [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md) attempted to _protect_ her. Lady Squatch failed, tripping as the worm leapt off of her shoulderpads and onto Lombardo's arm - sinking it's teeth deeply into her skin.

Shocked and panicking, [Detective Edgar Sanders](Bystanders/Detective%20Edgar%20Sanders.md) threw his cup of coffee at the worm injured by Dullface in order to pull out his service weapon and shoot the third worm which had started towards him. He shot it, but the worm paused - appearing only mildly annoyed. It glanced over at the first worm, who upon being touched by the lukewarm cup of coffee bSanders writhing in pain and screeching. All three worms scatter off into the museum away from the hunters.

Lady Squatch _soothed_ [Dr. Rosana Lombardo](Dr.%20Rosana%20Lombardo.md), who had begun to panic from the pain and bSanders to investigate her wound. Behind them, to herself, [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md) whispered _"Extraordinary. All three hatched."_ 

Lady Squatch observed that [Dr. Rosana Lombardo](Dr.%20Rosana%20Lombardo.md)'s wound was deep, but also lined with a green viscous liquid. She rubbed her finger through it and attempted to taste it, but right before she did, she _acted under pressure_ to vomit instead. If it weren't for her power suit, she would have taken damage from the venom.

After [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md) roused Dullface, Chonko and [Detective Edgar Sanders](Bystanders/Detective%20Edgar%20Sanders.md) eyed her suspiciously and demanded she revealed what she knew about the worms. Dr. Harrison admitted that while on the expedition she located three eggs of a new species she hoped to name _Bipalium Harrisoni_. As far as anyone in the world is concerned, these were brand new animals unknown to science that appear to have incredible natural healing and the ability to survive in extremely unhospitable and dry conditions. Dr. Harrison stood tall over [Detective Edgar Sanders](Bystanders/Detective%20Edgar%20Sanders.md) and declared that they were going to have to trap these worms alive - and she would do what it took to make that happen.

In the bathroom, Lady Squatch and [Dr. Rosana Lombardo](Dr.%20Rosana%20Lombardo.md) noted that the venom around the doctor's wound seemed to nearly instantly evaporate when washed in water. [Dr. Rosana Lombardo](Dr.%20Rosana%20Lombardo.md) also noted that while one of the worms took a bullet without much effect, another began screeching and fled after the coffee spilled into its rope burn from [Dullface](../../Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Dullface.md)'s nunchucks.

[Detective Edgar Sanders](Bystanders/Detective%20Edgar%20Sanders.md) attempted to call for backup, but found that the electrical disturbance generated by the worms had fried his (and everyone else's) electronics. [Everett Cobbs](Bystanders/Everett%20Cobbs.md) declared that they needed to lock down the museum to control any bad press and keep the worms from escaping. [Detective Edgar Sanders](Bystanders/Detective%20Edgar%20Sanders.md) agreed, and warned [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md) that she was likely guilty of obstruction - let alone customs and animal control violations.

The hunters and civilians determined that they needed to take [Dr. Rosana Lombardo](Dr.%20Rosana%20Lombardo.md) to safety and regroup in an employee break room. 

## Broad Strokes and Jump Cuts

> [!uh oh] 
> This is where the Keeper's note taking broke down. The Keeper tried to keep all the NPCs and Hunters together, but 4 NPCs and 3 independent monsters in the enormous museum degraded quality. The following is a quick summary of what happened.

[Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md) made it clear that she was going to try and save at least one of the worms, and would not help the hunters kill them. [Detective Edgar Sanders](Bystanders/Detective%20Edgar%20Sanders.md) decided to stay with the hunters, if only to keep an eye on [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md).

[Dr. Rosana Lombardo](Dr.%20Rosana%20Lombardo.md) was injured and needed to rest in the break room. [Everett Cobbs](Bystanders/Everett%20Cobbs.md)  felt he was no good to the hunters, and decided to look after the injured [Dr. Rosana Lombardo](Dr.%20Rosana%20Lombardo.md).

After discussing the worms with [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md), and [Dr. Rosana Lombardo](Dr.%20Rosana%20Lombardo.md), the hunters realized that the worms are adapted to hyperarid environments and found water poisonous. This is why they were able to take a bullet without stopping but fled when splashed with lukewarm coffee. The fact they were able to wash Dr. Lombardo's wounds with water also proved that the worm venom could be flushed out with water, but if not it would continue to harm them.

The hunters raided the break room fridge, grabbing canned seltzers like they were grenades and rolling the water cooler on [Dullface](Dullface.md)'s skateboard. They aimed to travel to the site where the bodies were discovered with [Detective Edgar Sanders](Bystanders/Detective%20Edgar%20Sanders.md) and [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md).

On the way to the scene, the hunters were ambushed by two worms on the 3rd floor Collections Core area. The hunters were able to wound one of the worms, which fled out of the room, chased by [Detective Edgar Sanders](Bystanders/Detective%20Edgar%20Sanders.md).  

During the battle with the other worms, the hunters knocked over the water cooler and caused it to spill down the stairs - empty. In the scuffle, the hunters killed one worm, which caused the remaining worm to flee elsewhere in the museum.

However, moments later, a triumphant [Detective Edgar Sanders](Bystanders/Detective%20Edgar%20Sanders.md) held up the lifeless body of worm he chased after. He then carefully travelled back to the break room to look after [Dr. Rosana Lombardo](Dr.%20Rosana%20Lombardo.md) and take a well-earned break.


## The Final Worm
Wounded and running out of canned soda, the hunters set out after the final worm. [Chonko](Chonko.md) _tuned in_ to the final worm, and located it a floor below them near the Asian Mammals area.

The hunters travelled to the location, but could not find the worm. [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md) and [Dullface](Dullface.md) split off to search the Asian Peoples room, while [Chonko](Chonko.md) and [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md) entered the Asian Mammals room.

With a strong whiff of ozone, the lights in the Asian Mammals room went out, bathing [Chonko](Chonko.md) and [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md) in darkness. [Chonko](Chonko.md) heard the sound of a fleshy plop, from across the room [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md) cried out _"Just because I don't want to kill these things doesn't give you the right to put your hands on me..._"

Acting quickly, [Chonko](Chonko.md) popped open a seltzer and dumped it on [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md), causing the worm to spin around, screeching, and bite into [Chonko](Chonko.md) before slithering in the direction of the other hunters and out of sight. [Chonko](Chonko.md)'s wounds caused her to become unstable.

[Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md) emptied the final bottle of water over [Chonko](Chonko.md)'s wounds, washing it clean of venom but leaving them without equipment to damage the monster lurking nearby. Realizing the dire nature of the situation, [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md) and [Chonko](Chonko.md) agreed that it might be necessary for [Chonko](Chonko.md) to use her magic to reach into the other realities for aid.

With [Chonko](Chonko.md) injured and unable to fight user her weapons, the hunters decided the best course of action was to enable [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md) to fight and defeat the worms. Despite [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md)'s efforts to keep [Chonko](Chonko.md) "pure" and away from the other realities, they agreed that [Chonko](Chonko.md) would _use magic_ to enchant [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md)'s razor whip and imbue it with water essence.

However, to perform the spell required the assistance of the caster and three willing participants. [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md) and [Dullface](Dullface.md) were up for it, but the only other person in the area was the reluctant [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md). 

[Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md) attempted to persuade [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md) that it was necessary to kill the worm in order to save [Chonko](Chonko.md)'s life and the lives of others, and even gave a little wink that made the Doctor realize that perhaps [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md) might be a biological discovery in her own right - and way more friendly.

Reaching into the other realities, [Chonko](Chonko.md) successfully imbued [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md)'s razor whip with the essence of water. This caused [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md) to feel guilt about failing her mission to keep [Chonko](Chonko.md) pure, even succumbing to the temptation of alternate realities herself. Despite her willingness to help with the ritual, [Dr. Kate Harrison](Minions/Dr.%20Kate%20Harrison.md) plead with the hunters to capture the worm alive for the sake of science.  

The ritual attracted the attention of the final worm, which leapt at  [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md), who was able to _act under pressure_ and dodge out of the way. Feeling the energy of her newly discovered magical ability, [Chonko](Chonko.md) reached into the otherworld and _used magic_ a second time to trap the worm.

The magic worked, but not flawlessly. The final worm was teleported into [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md)'s magical suit pocket - ruining [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md)'s signature power suit.

# Notes for the Future
- [Lady Squatch](Lady%20Squatch.md)'s suit is ruined, so it is time for a MAKEOVER. (If she wants)


The keeper poorly documented this session. In future sessions, the players will keep track of their rolls in a simple log.
