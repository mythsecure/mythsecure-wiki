## Overview

Mythsecure normally operates as a consultancy, but now and then the hunters get thoroughly involved in an engagement that extends beyond an initial statement of work and into their personal lives.

Mechanically, this is a multi-session story arc that can have its own characters and rule modifications. 


## Details for CAMPAIGN-NAME-REVEALED LATER

### Previous One-Offs are Non-Canon 
The events of [[One-Off Engagements/120 Westview Place/Session History - 120 Westview Place\|120 Westview Place]] and [[One-Off Engagements/200 Central Park West/Session History - 200 Central Park West\|200 Central Park West]] were not part of a wider campaign, and therefore exist in isolation. As these two sessions existed prior to the start of a larger campaign, they are effectively non-canon. 

### Penalty and Luck Reset
Character development ideas and the hunters' levels at the time of the campaign start will carry forward into the campaign, but the following items reset:

- **The Luck Counter**: Each hunter's luck will set back to zero out of seven. However, until events that transpire in the initial session, _hunters will not have access to their luck or the luck counter._
- **Penalties Forgiven:** During the investigation of [[One-Off Engagements/120 Westview Place/Session History - 120 Westview Place\|120 Westview Place]], [[Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Mr. Miata\|Mr. Miata]] used a Luck point and incurred a penalty in the form of bureaucratic red tape. [[Mythsecure-Organization/Hunters/Asha\|Asha]] failed a _net friends_ roll, and her followers believed her account had been hacked.
	- **For the campaign, these penalties are erased. **
